With the Integration Demo Component, you can showcase a live, real-time integration between Salesforce and a third-party solution, addressing key requirements frequently requested by our customers:


- Negotiated Price: Instantly retrieve the negotiated price from SAP based on the logged-in user and the product they are viewing.
- Add Negotiated Price to Cart: Once the customer views their negotiated price, these sales conditions are automatically applied when adding the product to their cart.
- Stock Information: Provide real-time stock information to your customers. If a product is out of stock, you can display the planned restock date.
- Send Order Header Information: Transmit the approved order to the external system and receive an External ID as an acknowledgment.
 

All these features are implemented using Flows, ensuring no code is required, allowing for quick adaptation based on your specific use cases.
